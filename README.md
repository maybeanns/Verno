# Verno - AI-Powered Multi-Agent VSCode Extension

Verno is an advanced VSCode extension that brings intelligent multi-agent AI capabilities to your development workflow. With automatic code quality validation, comprehensive feedback systems, and real-time progress tracking, Verno transforms how you build software.

## 🚀 Key Features

### Multi-Agent Orchestration System
- **Planning Agent**: Structured project planning with comprehensive documentation
- **BMAD Agents**: Business Analysis, Architecture, UX Design, Development, Product Management, QA, Technical Writing
- **Orchestrator**: Automatic workflow coordination and task distribution
- **Context-Aware**: Smart detection of new vs existing projects

### SDLC Automation & Jira Integration 🏗️
- **AI Persona Debate**: 4 distinct AI agents (PM, Architect, Frontend, QA) debate your feature request over 3 rounds.
- **Auto-PRD Generation**: Synthesizes the debate into a structured Product Requirements Document (PRD).
- **Jira Sync Engine**: Decomposes the approved PRD into Epics, Stories, and Subtasks, automatically pushing them to your connected Atlassian Jira project.
- **Resilient Webviews**: Rich, persistent UI panels for SDLC wizardry and Jira setup, featuring dry-run capabilities and crash-safe state recovery.

### Automatic Code Quality Validation ✨
The **DeveloperAgent** now includes a comprehensive 4-step quality pipeline that runs automatically after code generation:

1. **Dependency Installation** - Runs `npm install` automatically
2. **TypeScript Compilation** - Validates with `tsc --noEmit`
3. **Test Execution** - Runs `npm test` to ensure functionality
4. **Code Linting** - Checks code quality with `npm run lint`

All results are captured in detailed feedback reports with severity levels and actionable suggestions.

### Task Management & Progress Tracking
- **Auto-Generated TODOs**: Context-aware task creation based on project analysis
- **Real-Time Progress**: Visual progress tracking in VSCode status bar
- **Dependency Management**: Automatic task dependency chains
- **Priority Levels**: High, medium, low priority task categorization

### Agent Feedback System
- **Issue Tracking**: Critical, high, medium, low severity issue classification
- **Completed Tasks**: Comprehensive task completion logs
- **Suggestions**: Actionable recommendations for improvements
- **Next Steps**: Clear guidance on what to do next

### Conversation Management
- **Persistent History**: All planning and development conversations saved
- **Multiple Modes**: Planning, development, and chat conversation types
- **Export/Import**: Share conversations across team members
- **Agent Attribution**: Track which agent provided which insights

### Project Analysis
- **Language Detection**: Automatic identification of main programming language
- **Framework Detection**: Recognizes React, Vue, Next.js, Express, and more
- **Smart Scaffolding**: Different approaches for new vs existing projects
- **Dependency Tracking**: Analyzes and validates project dependencies

## 📊 UI Components

### Enhanced Sidebar
Browse through three powerful tabs:
- **TODOs**: View all agent tasks with status, priorities, and dependencies
- **Feedback**: See aggregated feedback from all agents with severity indicators
- **Conversations**: Access planning and development conversation history

### Activity Bar Progress
Real-time execution status displayed in your VSCode status bar:
- `$(pulse) Verno Ready` - Idle state
- `$(sync~spin) DeveloperAgent: 45%` - Running with progress
- `$(check) Verno Complete` - Successfully completed
- `$(error) Verno Error` - Error occurred

## 🛠️ Commands

- `Verno: Process User Input` - Start a new agent workflow
- `Verno: Start Recording` - Begin voice recording
- `Verno: Stop Recording` - End voice recording
- `Verno: Manage Agents` - Configure agent settings

## 📁 Project Structure

Verno creates a `.verno/` directory in your workspace:

```
workspace/
└── .verno/
    ├── conversations/          # Conversation history
    ├── todos/                  # TODO lists by agent
    ├── feedback/               # Agent feedback reports
    ├── PRD.md                 # Product Requirements Document (SDLC phase)
    ├── tasks.md               # Generated Epics and Stories
    ├── sdlc-state.json        # SDLC session state recovery
    ├── jira-config.json       # Jira project configuration
    ├── PROJECT_PLAN.md        # Planning output
    ├── ANALYSIS.md            # Business analysis
    ├── ARCHITECTURE.md        # System architecture
    └── QA_PLAN.md             # Test plans
```

## 🔧 Requirements

- VS Code 1.80.0 or higher
- Node.js 18 or higher
- API key for your chosen LLM provider (Gemini, Groq, OpenAI, or Anthropic)

## 🚦 Getting Started

1. **Install the extension** from the VSCode marketplace
2. **Open the sidebar** and click the Verno icon
3. **Add your API key** for your LLM provider
4. **Start coding!** Use voice or text to interact with agents

### Example Workflow

1. **SDLC Phase (Ideation & Tasks)**: "Build a new e-commerce app"
   - SDLC Webview intercepts project requests.
   - DebateOrchestrator runs 3-round AI debate and generates `PRD.md`.
   - User approves PRD and tasks are decomposed into Jira Epics & Stories.
   - Tasks are synced to Jira.

2. **Planning**: Orchestrator kicks in with the approved PRD
   - PlanningAgent generates comprehensive project plan
   - Orchestrator creates TODO list with dependencies
   
3. **Development**: Orchestrator executes BMAD pipeline
   - AnalystAgent performs business analysis
   - ArchitectAgent designs system architecture
   - UXDesignerAgent creates UX specifications
   - DeveloperAgent generates code **and validates quality**
   - QAEngineerAgent creates test plans
   - TechWriterAgent generates documentation

3. **Quality Check**: DeveloperAgent automatically:
   - Installs dependencies
   - Compiles TypeScript
   - Runs tests
   - Checks linting
   - **Generates feedback report**

4. **Review**: Check the feedback tab for issues and suggestions
