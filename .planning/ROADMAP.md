# Roadmap: Verno

## Overview

Verno owns the full 9-phase Software Development Life Cycle — from debate-driven requirements through deployed, monitored, and documented software — all inside VSCode. The roadmap is grouped by SDLC phase. Quick wins (GitHub integration, self-healing code gen, sprint auto-planner, security persona, changelog sync) are front-loaded into the first three milestones.

## Phases

- [ ] **Phase 1: Security & Extension Foundation** — SecretStorage, webview guards, metadata, provider cleanup
- [ ] **Phase 2: Conversational Mode Upgrade** — SDLC-aware advisor with real-time workspace intelligence
- [ ] **Phase 3: PRD Hardening (SDLC Phase 1)** — Security persona, ambiguity detector, version diffing, traceability matrix
- [ ] **Phase 4: Planning & Estimation (SDLC Phase 2)** — Story point agent, sprint auto-planner, dependency graph
- [ ] **Phase 5: Architecture & Design (SDLC Phase 3)** — ADRs, Mermaid diagrams, OpenAPI contracts
- [ ] **Phase 6: Self-Healing Code Generation (SDLC Phase 4)** — Error retry loop, conflict resolver, incremental diffs
- [ ] **Phase 7: Testing & QA (SDLC Phase 5)** — Unit test auto-gen, E2E scaffolding, coverage sidebar
- [ ] **Phase 8: CI/CD & GitHub Integration (SDLC Phase 6)** — GitHub Actions, Dockerfile/K8s, repo detection, PR creation
- [ ] **Phase 9: Monitoring & Observability (SDLC Phase 7)** — OpenTelemetry, Grafana dashboards, runbooks
- [ ] **Phase 10: Security & Compliance (SDLC Phase 8)** — OWASP checklists, secret scanning, GDPR flags
- [ ] **Phase 11: Documentation & Knowledge Base (SDLC Phase 9)** — README sync, changelog gen, JSDoc
- [ ] **Phase 12: Multi-Provider LLM & Streaming UI** — Anthropic + OpenAI providers, streaming markdown renderer
- [ ] **Phase 13: Agent Test Coverage & CI for Verno** — MockLLMService, unit tests, GitHub Actions for extension itself
- [ ] **Phase 14: Polish, Documentation & VSIX Package** — FYP packaging, onboarding, final VSIX

## Phase Details

### Phase 1: Security & Extension Foundation
**Goal**: Fix critical security issues (SecretStorage, webview guards) and extension metadata. Clean baseline before any new feature work.
**Depends on**: Nothing (first phase)
**Requirements**: SEC-04, SEC-05, EXT-04
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):
  1. API keys stored in VSCode SecretStorage — not prompted via dialog on repeat sessions
  2. Webview panels reject unknown message types with a logged warning
  3. Extension output channel not auto-opened on activation
  4. Agent artifacts write to `.verno/` only — not workspace root
  5. Extension version 0.2.0, publisher not "yourname"
**Plans**: 3 plans

Plans:
- [x] 01-01: Secure API Key Storage — migrate to vscode.SecretStorage
- [x] 01-02: Webview Message Security — allowlist validation + CSP audit
- [x] 01-03: Extension Metadata & Logger Polish — version, publisher, output paths

### Phase 2: Conversational Mode Upgrade
**Goal**: Transform the basic chat mode into a true SDLC-aware conversational advisor that interprets workspace context and delivers real-time insights.
**Depends on**: Phase 1
**Requirements**: MOD-01
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):
  1. Conversational mode detects active file type and tailors its response (security for .env, architecture for services/)
  2. User can ask "what are the vulnerabilities in this file?" and get an OWASP-backed answer
  3. ConversationEngine includes workspace summary in system prompt automatically
  4. Mode clearly communicated in UI (toggle: Conversational ↔ Development)
**Plans**: 2 plans

Plans:
- [x] 02-01: SDLC-Aware ConversationEngine — workspace-context system prompt, mode detection
- [ ] 02-02: Mode Toggle UI — sidebar toggle, context-aware response templates

### Phase 3: PRD Hardening (SDLC Phase 1)
**Goal**: Make PRD generation industry-grade — with a security persona, ambiguity detection, version tracking, and a traceability matrix.
**Depends on**: Phase 1
**Requirements**: PRD-01, PRD-02, PRD-03, PRD-04
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):
  1. Debate has 8 agents (Security added as 8th)

**Plans**: 3 plans

Plans:
- [x] 03-01: Security Persona in Debate — 8th agent with OWASP/GDPR focus

**Depends on**: Phase 5
**Requirements**: COD-01, COD-02, COD-03
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):
  1. After code gen, if `tsc --noEmit` fails, DeveloperAgent re-generates with error context (max 3 retries)
